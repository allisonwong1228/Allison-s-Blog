title: "Hi! My name is Allison!"
description: |
  I decided I wanted to start a website/blog and create a positive mental space, while also posting many of my interests. The name of my Blog is 'Little White Orchids'. I picked this name because my favorite flowers are gardenias and white orchids; an orchid was the flower I thought I had made out of paper for my grandma when I was at school and ever since, I have loved orchids because of the sentimental ambience and the elegance of an orchid.
